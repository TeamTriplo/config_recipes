This is a very basic FAQ feature that comes with:

1) Content type
2) Three custom fields
3) One view of People - page and block
4) One custom image style

The views are currently labeled as TEAM, this is easily edited in the view.

We are adding some CSS to the Tatsu theme to help make the Team view look better out of the box.
