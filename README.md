# backdrop-features
A directory of config features for export / experimentation

As a start, each directory should contain the config files for one feature. In theory, we should be able to add the config files from any feature directory to an existing Backdrop project and then synchronize the config files, to add that feature to the site. 

As of this time, we done very little experimentation to test how this works. 

Please, help make this documentation better.
